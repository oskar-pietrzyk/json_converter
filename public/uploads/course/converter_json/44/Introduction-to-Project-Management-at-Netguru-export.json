It’s a web app that was supposed to make sales representatives\u0026#x27; lives easier by being a one stop shop for managing all client communications. The designs were done, tested and \u003cem\u003eabsolutely beautiful\u003c/em\u003e, pixel perfect one might say! Client was happy with the outcome, test users were impressed, investors excited, and I was beyond myself to be working with such a cool product. All left to do was to actually build it, right? \u003cstrong\u003eNope.\u003c/strong\u003e As usual, the devil was in the details. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eACT 1 - \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eLearn what you don’t know\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe client decided to do design first for 3 months, then reestimate and start the development phase. Maybe it wasn’t a perfect setup, but hey - it is what it is! We treated it as any other opp, got all of the materials from the previous PM before her offboarding, onboarded presales experts and prepared an estimation. It was packed with AI, ML, 3rd party integrations - that’s what the client wanted after all. We scheduled an expert call to present it and… \u003cstrong\u003egot grilled. Hard.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTurns out, scope changed in the meanwhile. It wasn’t always reflected on the designs, wasn’t really documented. Some decisions were taken by both the project team and the client, clients\u0026#x27; expectations were supposedly communicated, yet… without any paper trail. We failed to estimate what client asked for at some point, but included features that were removed earlier. We were WAY over budget. After a couple of iterations, desperate search for reliable information and some very intense calls, it became clear we have \u003cem\u003eno common ground\u003c/em\u003e - it was like we were speaking two completely different languages. We were caught in the he said, she said game and losing client’s trust bit by bit, so we needed to take a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eACT 2 - \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTalk about goals, not features\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was time to bring out the big guns and put our consulting hats on. We reached out to @Rafał Gawlik and @Mateusz Krawczyński to help us move forward constructively. We knew now the budget was limited and the go-to-market date was getting closer and closer. Next steps became clear: \u003cstrong\u003eprioritise and plan.\u003c/strong\u003e Did you ever have this moment when you ask the client about what’s most important for them, and they say EVERYTHING? Yeah. And in our case, they really didn’t know - they just assumed everything is doable, so they wanted it. And we assumed at least 50% of the features don’t make sense, as we didn’t understand why they want to have them. \u003cstrong\u003eBoth NG and Messeji teams got some homework to do.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetguru\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eGet the whole project knowledge under control to not have another \u003cem\u003efaux pas.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrepare a high-level implementation roadmap with different phases.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDive deeper into architecture and integrations to make future estimates as precise as possible.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMesseji\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eMVP OKRs - what should the MVP achieve and how do we measure it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eList all the features and prioritize them with MoSCoW.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eScore \u003cem\u003eMust have\u003c/em\u003e features to determine real priorities.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were a lot of statements, requirements, documents and research flying around at the time. \u003cstrong\u003eWe needed structure\u003c/strong\u003e to make sure we don’t get lost again.

It’s a web app that was supposed to make sales representatives\u0026#x27; lives easier by being a one stop shop for managing all client communications. The designs were done, tested and \u003cem\u003eabsolutely beautiful\u003c/em\u003e, pixel perfect one might say! Client was happy with the outcome, test users were impressed, investors excited, and I was beyond myself to be working with such a cool product. All left to do was to actually build it, right? \u003cstrong\u003eNope.\u003c/strong\u003e As usual, the devil was in the details. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eACT 1 - \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eLearn what you don’t know\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe client decided to do design first for 3 months, then reestimate and start the development phase. Maybe it wasn’t a perfect setup, but hey - it is what it is! We treated it as any other opp, got all of the materials from the previous PM before her offboarding, onboarded presales experts and prepared an estimation. It was packed with AI, ML, 3rd party integrations - that’s what the client wanted after all. We scheduled an expert call to present it and… \u003cstrong\u003egot grilled. Hard.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTurns out, scope changed in the meanwhile. It wasn’t always reflected on the designs, wasn’t really documented. Some decisions were taken by both the project team and the client, clients\u0026#x27; expectations were supposedly communicated, yet… without any paper trail. We failed to estimate what client asked for at some point, but included features that were removed earlier. We were WAY over budget. After a couple of iterations, desperate search for reliable information and some very intense calls, it became clear we have \u003cem\u003eno common ground\u003c/em\u003e - it was like we were speaking two completely different languages. We were caught in the he said, she said game and losing client’s trust bit by bit, so we needed to take a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eACT 2 - \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTalk about goals, not features\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was time to bring out the big guns and put our consulting hats on. We reached out to @Rafał Gawlik and @Mateusz Krawczyński to help us move forward constructively. We knew now the budget was limited and the go-to-market date was getting closer and closer. Next steps became clear: \u003cstrong\u003eprioritise and plan.\u003c/strong\u003e Did you ever have this moment when you ask the client about what’s most important for them, and they say EVERYTHING? Yeah. And in our case, they really didn’t know - they just assumed everything is doable, so they wanted it.

Team consisted of 2 Designers, 1 Illustrator and 1 Branding Specialist (added at the end of the project) and PM. The client team consisted of Bitvavo co-founder who was a  main point of contact and our decision maker. Client was the product owner. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Bitvavo platform was launched in 2018, with the goal to bridge the gap between traditional currencies and digital assets. It has become the largest digital assets exchange in Netherlands and one of the leading European cryptocurrency exchanges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOur goal was to design a friendly yet professional user interface and simplify user experience for the platform so the Client can target becoming a Leader in Europe.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA pivot happened on 21-08-2020 when a Client suddenly shared a a lot of negative feedback and wanted to stop proceeding with the Illustrations.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLessons Learned 📓\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTeamwork \u003c/strong\u003e\n• \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTeamwork makes a dream work\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e Sometimes to sell one team member ideas we need to use other\u0026#x27;s authority.

Never stop educating the Client that negative feedback is super important if there is any and the sooner we give it the better. Sometimes it may be even helpful to “provoke” Client to give this feedback, only to ensure that what he says about our work is what he really means. \n• A lot of \u003cem\u003edetailed feedback\u003c/em\u003e that does not give a holistic overview of the direction that we should choose should be a warning sign.\n• If the Client is not able to specify style or after kick-off we discover that style is one the most important aspects for him we should propose workshop or discovery session.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelations \u003c/strong\u003e\n• Relations with the Client built on partnership helps a lot, when we position ourselves as experts that Client can trust it’s easier to recover from difficult situations. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDesign process\u003c/strong\u003e\n• It\u0026#x27;s worth to involve experts in a particular area and do not assume that PD and UI expert will do it in the meantime. In our case it was branding.

We asked the Client to give us last chance and allow to propose completely new approach to illustrations, not taking into account his detailed feedback that he gave before. I worked out.  Also when the Client has to detailed vision regarding illustrations and almost draw it for us it should be a warning sign. \n• It\u0026#x27;s very helpful when developer is involved in design project so can provide feedback on the regular basis. We were lucky to have this person (Client was also a developer), but in other projects we should always remember about these consultations. \n• If there is not dedicated person for branding maybe area expert should be consulted.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePresales and Estimations\u003c/strong\u003e\n• It pays off when the scope is re-estimated at the very beginning and monitored on the regular basis.
