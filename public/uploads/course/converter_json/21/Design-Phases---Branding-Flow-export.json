The problem with providing any benchmarks that might provide an additional insight, is that branding quality is hard to quantify in any meaningful way, as it‚Äôs difficult, if not impossible, to measure in any objective manner.\nUltimately, the goal of the research is to determine who will need to be ‚Äúimpressed‚Äù by the end result of the task at hand.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{"entityRefreshHax":1}},{"key":"5dr4m","text":" ","type":"atomic","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":1,"key":0}],"data":{}},{"key":"botcr","text":"\nAn excellent example of a properly conducted and concluded market research can be found in AltoStack‚Äôs research report that can be viewed here:¬†","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"8dlgr","text":"Altostack research - G.Drive","type":"unordered-list-item","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":28,"key":1}],"data":{}}],"entityMap":{"0":{"type":"image","mutability":"IMMUTABLE","data":{"uploadId":null,"src":"https://cdn.dub.bridgeapp.com/512/1/uploads/00ca874f-b669-43a4-ac43-f60b1c8da0e6.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3D0.png\u0026Expires=1615379483\u0026Signature=LYbbSdo-X68a9MVlNEuiqmZpQX4d6WO~iQ44kGkoks95UOAWYOT4dZY9~EvzNJuN3GKvUtOma-8AP5xFrsdnd-KeNNK6seYzvYsEVjf99hLjBCxu36zWc3ILKN7gIQjVO940D4SNcivv0n0WC8q7F3DuIkGvERvMwuz~Y37Wr4rUdEXA-198zvxX7RDGh2BVU7wUFeKrmUkZRJdJJQAfDaNAqGmjVb7ltPCCVDIPCgVgdrCyM5AYM6sAuDR~ekxRYII4E~luo2PtyjoTMeun6CTnr-JdyOx4zksSx-AGiu5SJCs1HwANeagxIB9mmtFC0gkRfidyHdBCXfX67o9OEQ__\u0026Key-Pair-Id=APKAJXAC3ZZLINBJN2EQ","attachmentId":"2479"}},"1":{"type":"LINK","mutability":"MUTABLE","data":{"href":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vrniV2OTutHDu31ySuUOQd8J6nEV_Cej/view","rel":"nofollow","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vrniV2OTutHDu31ySuUOQd8J6nEV_Cej/view"}}}},"answers":[],"feedback":null,"cover_slide_data":{}},"published_at":"2021-03-29T15:32:41.312+02:00","estimated_time":2,"attachments_count":1,"presentable":true,"external_id":null,"attachments":[{"id":2479,"notorious_id":null,"location":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bridge-learn-file-store-prod-dub/512/1/uploads/00ca874f-b669-43a4-ac43-f60b1c8da0e6.png","duration":null,"name":"0.png","learner_visible":true,"confirmed":false,"user_id":977,"context_type":"Slide","content_type":"image/png","file_modified_at":null,"availability":"complete","media":null,"migrated_at":null,"sources":[]}]},{"id":1219,"position":5,"new_position":5,"published_attributes":{"type":"slide","title":"üéØ Business Goals ","body":null,"serialized_body":"\u003cp\u003eIt‚Äôs important to remember that it‚Äôs the client‚Äôs responsibility to determine what their business goals are.

Photos, Color Palette, UI Elements, Typography etc.\n\nWhile creating Moodboards you should have your design direction which you would like to present to the client in mind.
