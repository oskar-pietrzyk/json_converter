(giving more freedom in hierarchy design), additional glyphs and ligatures and a decent kerning table. A paid font also helps to build a more unique visual voice making it easier to stand out from the crowd. This seems to be of small importance, but keep in mind, that web and mobile products are in 95% based on typography.
