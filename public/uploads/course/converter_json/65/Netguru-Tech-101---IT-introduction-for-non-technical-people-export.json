However, it is very common that we do not know what exactly our colleagues do. This is especially visible when it comes to our tech stuff, so I would like to give you an introduction to what our tech stuff does, what tools they use, and how they use it. My goal with this course is to seal the gap between tech people and non-tech people at Netguru. If you work with developers, QA specialists or Dev-Ops guys on daily basis. And you don\u0026#x27;t feel too comfortable communicating with them. Or sometimes you just don\u0026#x27;t understand what they say, those videos are for you. I want to take you on a journey, where I will try to explain in a human-friendly way what tech people do, how they do it, and why they do it.

I do not hold a computer science degree, and I start learning by myself. This is why, I dare to say, that I kind of understand what the struggle it might be to understand what\u0026#x27;s going on in the tech world. So without further ado let\u0026#x27;s start our course.

I do not hold a computer science degree, and I start learning by myself. This is why, I dare to say, that I kind of understand what the struggle it might be to understand what\u0026#x27;s going on in the tech world. So without further ado let\u0026#x27;s start our course.

That\u0026#x27;s because it\u0026#x27;s very very ubiquitous. It may currently be the most popular programming language it has as many haters as fans but the truth - is it\u0026#x27;s everywhere. It can be used for both the backend and frontend. That means that the person who knows javascript can write both the backend and front-end of an application using one language. From the business point of view, this means that the client can hire one developer which means spending less money. Isn\u0026#x27;t that beautiful? Although it sounds nice in theory, reality can be very different.

Now that we know what the framework is, let\u0026#x27;s talk about frameworks that you may hear about at Netguru. We are going to start by talking about backend frameworks. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBackend Frameworks\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo first and foremost let me start with the framework that Netguru started with and which it owes a great deal of success. This is of course \u003ca href=\"https://rubyonrails.org/\"\u003eRuby on Rails\u003c/a\u003e. Ruby on Rails is the main framework written in the Ruby language. There are other Ruby frameworks like \u003ca href=\"http://sinatrarb.com/\"\u003esinatra\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://hanamirb.org/\"\u003ehanami\u003c/a\u003e, but when someone says - I\u0026#x27;m a ruby developer - you can be almost sure that this means I\u0026#x27;m a ruby on rails developer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRuby on Rails\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what is Ruby on Rails and what it\u0026#x27;s used for? Long story short it\u0026#x27;s \u003cstrong\u003eused for writing the backend part of applications\u003c/strong\u003e.

Thanks to that Ruby on Rails codebase is predictable which is a good thing because it speeds up development a lot. When talking about the development speed with Ruby on Rails many things come out of the box which means it's a perfect solution for creating MVPs. Many people claim that Ruby on Rails is dying because it's not scalable and is slow. Those can, in fact, be the negative sides of Ruby, but truth be said, for 99% of projects what Ruby on Rails offers is completely sufficient, it's a well-established framework and is actively maintained which means it's not going anywhere anytime soon.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":71,"length":49,"style":"BOLD"},{"offset":160,"length":54,"style":"BOLD"},{"offset":510,"length":99,"style":"BOLD"}],"entityRanges":[{"offset":605,"length":3,"key":4}],"data":{}},{"key":"4kuus","text":"","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"6vl4m","text":" ","type":"atomic","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":1,"key":5}],"data":{}},{"key":"6uiac","text":"","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"fgkt0","text":"django ","type":"header-three","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"3feur","text":"django is another backend framework that we use at Netguru. django is written in Python.

Let\u0026#x27;s dive into it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore we begin talking about the most popular frameworks as of 2019 let me stress one thing. Front-end world is much more different than the backend. Backend world has been based on a couple of well-established frameworks and hardly ever does it happen that a new framework appears and changes existing situation 180 degrees. In the front end world everything is much more dynamic and temporary. Five years ago currently the most popular framework didn\u0026#x27;t even exist. That creates a risk of this movie quickly becoming out of date. Nevertheless, let me present your current situation as of 2019. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.dub.bridgeapp.com/512/1/uploads/12445eb1-2f21-49f4-8598-f572d86b14cd.jpeg?response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3DIMG_BD42D9837A62-1.jpeg\u0026amp;Expires=1615739429\u0026amp;Signature=UAc1eGS2UG0Yr9ccNAO1rW4kbi4AKqshtFPWh65H~5v0OGTFNMruBFD1T9DpiVkFl6bLg7hjrOZY22W~uM9n~Qd~fqgxzxHbikKQzSE6bJgFdyRbK090J2dGhBvn~o4HRMsKmGXOq52rdg-dQyjiyFlFTKJf2mCiAv7dOS9NwK31Dv-BDWU2f~A7F5mGNk0aHUT7bREy-KylO0ZjoqlvzW7leG4uqR~7dk9qnHvy8~UJ8FHLMxZQCabOggadxR1AgS-qqb4SvZX98fBIxPW3Y0Mtfq3ZLH12D22ww0pb479j67LpbvD7l2URoT1vrR6STpYo2fODORJmcbnZgdTyng__\u0026amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJXAC3ZZLINBJN2EQ\"/\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Netguru, we basically rely on three front-end frameworks. \u003cstrong\u003eReact, Vue\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eAngular.\u003c/strong\u003e Comparing these frameworks would mean that we would have to get a little bit nerdy. Instead, I just want to explain to you some general rules of front frameworks and give you a short introduction to each of them. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.dub.bridgeapp.com/512/1/uploads/75357998-cbfa-4f2d-b6ec-26867711e30a.jpeg?response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3DIMG_432EACB434E7-1.jpeg\u0026amp;Expires=1615739418\u0026amp;Signature=XIg0I8KIAuaudg-UeuQ2yvtWU2x32iCmEZ2iuKOtp5ncuV7LILLABzesTIh8OUpPZfl65Vjz5~EFPmuJ7rLQAXciBq6UaUYYFBnOnr1U~~f3cHBs0jel3~gyBB34t~pgHVj3MfSZf-V8B97E4sDYoZkH3sN5sZp4~BwT61vZWQYbifbqY5nxvMBkhjfCQ59RTnfaRuHq1m7veXTO3k4fiR2AKyjpMeKPEa9VOXS71YxO6pKOEi9PR~LQbveV0da3wi6lo-wLZsxg6cOxfT92Hog0FFOqJFtcQ~5vZb0qnfORu68gafg8J~9ch~zKgbpTVgTTZApCGD5xc9SYNmCmOA__\u0026amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJXAC3ZZLINBJN2EQ\"/\u003e\u003cp\u003eBasically, this is how front frameworks work. There\u0026#x27;s some general app layout that consists of many components. A framework sets some guidelines as to how to write those components. The underlying principle is the same in every framework. Components consist of HTML CSS and JavaScript. In most cases, data in component A is dependent on data in component B, so there needs to be some communication between them and that\u0026#x27;s basically what the frontend framework does. It sets some guidelines for writing components and transferring data from one component to another. So if all front-end frameworks use JavaScript and the principle is similar everywhere why are there so many of them? React, Angular and Vue are just the ones that we use at Netguru, but trust me there\u0026#x27;s many more. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.dub.bridgeapp.com/512/1/uploads/5878ab1c-a73e-481c-836c-3396ce994f29.jpeg?response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3DIMG_BB564333070F-1.jpeg\u0026amp;Expires=1615739642\u0026amp;Signature=da1tcSyN9zz9rWR4prhQWAUzMbQOC4QJuWq8nf00FuMrYQ5bcSjpgELAZMTHsKixYR98-aUYUnrNswfe4QgZs~g45gdmPxRK1tBt5psHDKra3Os3BBqWBGVvk0Ii1NX6TZxvOMeo5UknfSyawU21JVd64Mfz1HYSuLUopbkfc5iRrI5EW2fWiQxqVfCEiGXljddRHI5kEA2QE4Lpdr9xcXbWFThF8EixBCy~a4ViKSeu2QZ543JKlOWwgy23hzusUPaiV~R0DQovEv3OKTCR58inTpgN0wpMJblkTvmwh~c5Tj8ui4YEBJxz8W9BC39avSuIeQCCpPrE80kHTpXszg__\u0026amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJXAC3ZZLINBJN2EQ\"/\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo answer this question we need to look at the bigger picture.

Companies like Google and Facebook have the capacity to promote their products. Knowing that there\u0026#x27;s a big player behind the framework gives developers some confidence that it\u0026#x27;s not going to be replaced quickly by another tool. Vue, however, is different. It\u0026#x27;s not supported by any big tech player. It\u0026#x27;s an open-source project created entirely by independent developers. Although it\u0026#x27;s been adapted by Netguru and classified as an area we want to explore. Its market sure is currently the lowest among those three mentioned frameworks. Don\u0026#x27;t get me wrong it doesn\u0026#x27;t mean that it\u0026#x27;s worse. It\u0026#x27;s just how things are. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince we\u0026#x27;re not going to get too technical.

What you see here is data in a JSON format. JSON is the most popular data exchange format and this is what we are delivering to frontend developers. Now a front-end developer needs to process this data and present it in a visually attractive way. I have already prepared the template for displaying expenses and all I need to do is just populate it with the data I get from the backend. So if we were to show how the data is processed, it would look as follows. It starts as raw data and database, then is exposed in a JSON format just to end up in a final template. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.dub.bridgeapp.com/512/1/uploads/a00e80bc-53cb-4304-b6db-e29d41aba91a.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3DScreenshot%2B2021-03-14%2Bat%2B17.57.45.png\u0026amp;Expires=1615742890\u0026amp;Signature=mtBTJnEYUrb3WLWPXATzvCLHWa4Jur7vVxwkLx8W6cf1HhEmE4F4h649MvII2B3H3RTUhZQek-24gRWdRZUN7vra5P5HHYvf9VYiDMI7T3f~XQ0e4kUau9xwMFSmoeiwmIS2YGLgoCCKDrjBhaoIW08LS9lxrbQv2dEYafJOfJ5ehS3phAYjsIZ09jp3aL~y5-~DM3UUphkS8iMVFiwTuPBin6TEEWeexIviX176owormDFGVFaQwCyHL9kHwIOVu0-CknkK8N75aaxaQf6OigsfGyYSvVVjq8EmkWN5iB9kGhhlkkd7WTzXNFZMremj5-GgCOCTxibfqzoLUrq0lA__\u0026amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJXAC3ZZLINBJN2EQ\"/\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.dub.bridgeapp.com/512/1/uploads/e6747ec1-4a6d-4295-9eeb-f4b00dba15b2.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3DScreenshot%2B2021-03-14%2Bat%2B17.57.55.png\u0026amp;Expires=1615742893\u0026amp;Signature=XehAWdOrqZh22WFvif5UKZH-UZ46HUDI8X5AxlyuwWw8U90bjAZG1fFLGsjDP9QhO4bz8XjdAO7KF~MSjUqLpiotTqvge3W7fLcPR9nxhweGnXjAHZGmej-Z7aCYYNZWq7gIInNUNA7nb98EzMsoa7Qsv2E8QA-9I8sjlQEEJmiy2yvFCJTKTivRDzW~~~h5fDAk6FS2cl9luX959QlFka1JUdNTLEI1VbNEFQ72380M~6iflMTBtdvoW~eHmLrNrhI-2DZiLC6vaS0n4~EZD9TL0InV0JvGbW45LmimZkVdGTk~Sm~DrEVVW-N9hsNt~ao182vbHGYLPSoVJFJ6aA__\u0026amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJXAC3ZZLINBJN2EQ\"/\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.dub.bridgeapp.com/512/1/uploads/d36248e2-0a83-4652-8156-055c72842656.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3DScreenshot%2B2021-03-14%2Bat%2B17.57.59.png\u0026amp;Expires=1615742897\u0026amp;Signature=CJV~5aq7~YaJS9dielOvMUW6~y6URZmGt4kTIj0h-7nhKeWgpMa1zcW-msKpYX~Fdo4cv6cE6e7afEVGjQzkQmrDGvPC9CGSm5g0r6xdBISP0o1WscROwHGynMxwv7Aoic51oaZ54xRaVavTuug2kvrZMpD9NHTsSxurslnRSdOjwCaAKUBvPQ0wMhiInGzDw2fIuBjKKGrNgpCgdBR2Ole-ZwFmL88uVvX35IJuNJhgud5zajUikO6DHLvxBH21eVvnzdB3fSPCgwnhQ3g5mtvASQ9Hzx0njO-iu6bCxyk~eyHy~r0ITLL-r1WqUxgjX5PJtOMlXjp-5VTSmQ5ZBg__\u0026amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJXAC3ZZLINBJN2EQ\"/\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo this is what the cooperation between backend and front-end developers looks like in a nutshell.

So far we\u0026#x27;ve talked a lot about programming languages and frameworks. Those tools alone wouldn\u0026#x27;t get us too far. Developing an application is a team effort.

When talking about Git, I think it\u0026#x27;s a good idea to use some comparisons. Before we do that, I have to introduce one crucial Git related word. The code repository is also known as just repository or repo. We can imagine a repo as a folder containing some files. The main difference though is the fact that Git repo stores very precise history of each file which means that if you are using files from any git repo you are able to see the exact history of a file. Who did what, why did he do it, and when did he do it. That\u0026#x27;s what version control stands for another very important part of Git definition is the word distributed. What exactly does it mean. It means that repositories can be accessed from any computer and they are going to look the same for every person accessing them. That means that every developer in a project can see an up-to-date version of applications code. See who, why make some changes and also move back to previous code versions if there\u0026#x27;s a need to. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eGithub\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026#x27;s talk about Github now. Github is just a web client that serves the Git system. Thanks to Github you can store and make your repositories accessible on the web. In other words, this is just a hub for the code which is accessible for developers involved in a project. Let\u0026#x27;s see what it looks like. This is Netguru\u0026#x27;s Github page. If we go to a sample repo we can see that this indeed looks like a folder with other folders and some files. This is a remote repository. Remote repository means that it\u0026#x27;s a repo stored on Github server. A local repo would be a repo that we have downloaded to our computer. We can go and explore each file. We can see who made what changes, why did he make them and when did he make them. The red part is the code that\u0026#x27;s been deleted and the green part is the code that\u0026#x27;s been added. This repo is accessible to everyone at Netguru and everybody can contribute. In order to do so, one just has to clone the repo. Cloning a repo is just downloading it on your computer. After the repo is on your computer, you can just push changes to the remote repo and the rest is history. That\u0026#x27;s how software is made.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026#x27;s gonna be it for Git and Github. I hope that the concept of Git is clear to you now.

So far we\u0026#x27;ve talked a lot about programming languages and frameworks. Those tools alone wouldn\u0026#x27;t get us too far. Developing an application is a team effort. The code needs to be managed and shared between developers. In this episode, we are going to talk about Git and Github let\u0026#x27;s dive into it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eGit\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are going to start with git let\u0026#x27;s take a look at the official definition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt; GIT is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026#x27;s analyze this definition. When talking about Git, I think it\u0026#x27;s a good idea to use some comparisons. Before we do that, I have to introduce one crucial Git related word. The code repository is also known as just repository or repo. We can imagine a repo as a folder containing some files. The main difference though is the fact that Git repo stores very precise history of each file which means that if you are using files from any git repo you are able to see the exact history of a file. Who did what, why did he do it, and when did he do it. That\u0026#x27;s what version control stands for another very important part of Git definition is the word distributed. What exactly does it mean. It means that repositories can be accessed from any computer and they are going to look the same for every person accessing them. That means that every developer in a project can see an up-to-date version of applications code. See who, why make some changes and also move back to previous code versions if there\u0026#x27;s a need to. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eGithub\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026#x27;s talk about Github now. Github is just a web client that serves the Git system. Thanks to Github you can store and make your repositories accessible on the web. In other words, this is just a hub for the code which is accessible for developers involved in a project. Let\u0026#x27;s see what it looks like. This is Netguru\u0026#x27;s Github page. If we go to a sample repo we can see that this indeed looks like a folder with other folders and some files. This is a remote repository. Remote repository means that it\u0026#x27;s a repo stored on Github server. A local repo would be a repo that we have downloaded to our computer. We can go and explore each file. We can see who made what changes, why did he make them and when did he make them. The red part is the code that\u0026#x27;s been deleted and the green part is the code that\u0026#x27;s been added. This repo is accessible to everyone at Netguru and everybody can contribute. In order to do so, one just has to clone the repo. Cloning a repo is just downloading it on your computer. After the repo is on your computer, you can just push changes to the remote repo and the rest is history. That\u0026#x27;s how software is made.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026#x27;s gonna be it for Git and Github. I hope that the concept of Git is clear to you now.

Let\u0026#x27;s dive into it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow that we know what Git and Github are, we already talk about how the code flows. In this particular video, we will learn about pull requests and how we approach them at Netguru. By now you should already know where the repo is. Let\u0026#x27;s imagine I have to implement a small change in the application. The client wants to display a funny message after a link is clicked. Repo contains files with the code. One very important feature of Git repos is the ability to create branches. Just like the ones on the tree. This is also the metaphor that we are going to use. In our case the final version of an application, also called the master branch, would be the tree trunk. According to our Netguru flow, \u003cstrong\u003eevery new feature is written on a new branch.\u003c/strong\u003e And that\u0026#x27;s exactly what I\u0026#x27;m going to do first.

This is because the amount of data can impact efficiency of some operations. What works locally doesn\u0026#x27;t have to work perfectly with larger amounts of data. The purpose of staging then is to test new features under production-like conditions to mitigate any risk when deploying to production.

Opening a pull request means that the developer is working on, is ready, thus it is ready to test. That means that for every pull request there is a new staging with a particular feature.

Let\u0026#x27;s start with dynamic staging. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eDynamic Staging\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDynamic staging is created when a developer opens a pull request. Opening a pull request means that the developer is working on, is ready, thus it is ready to test. That means that for every pull request there is a new staging with a particular feature. After the pull request is merged and the corresponding branch is deleted the particular instance of staging is terminated. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.dub.bridgeapp.com/512/1/uploads/ed74e1d3-61e0-46e5-81f6-6c42c02d5655.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3DScreenshot%2B2021-03-14%2Bat%2B21.18.47.png\u0026amp;Expires=1615754937\u0026amp;Signature=Dm6HkYsvtgjgyorZ7hWZVs92kX1tAHYui-bTVSi1aPDS0GzRVWEmxXg3deToNei38-8VTYYi0EXwREyGybcRbpoD-ekwHMEkCZZvh4yUDUfGuQ30TovRNO1hykWIzR5GQuhYJYdEhdrijGtraLGFzsc2aCbXa9fJ67G-Sk1ErcYGdCCXr7gogteqy9zpsJucD~Kgrcd4HGnxw08lk4JNweBdaJdBxFkq3MqgXaM25QCcN7AeHpECim0YuB6UvdURPJbf9rJ80VDXfjzH4yjQbkqszjwHY7ZqgqTyZ1gU1FBb9-80vyhS5A4QiS-1XiltO86MvwzX85jvzrO3WmG2cg__\u0026amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJXAC3ZZLINBJN2EQ\"/\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eStatic Staging\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe principle of static staging environment is completely different.
